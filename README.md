Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to represent hierarchical relationships. This project demonstrates how to create and manipulate binary trees using the C programming language.

Features
Insertion: Add nodes to the binary tree.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the binary tree.
Searching: Find nodes within the binary tree.
Traversal: Traverse the binary tree in various orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
